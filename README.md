#NewsToMe

In this last election cycle, there has been a growing realization that the distribution of news based on the interests of different markets has a huge impact. This project has two aims:

1. To understand how different outlets tailor their news to different markets.
2. To expand my own understanding of scraping websites in Python.

The project relies on the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.
